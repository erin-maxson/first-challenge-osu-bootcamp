# <module-challenge-1-code-refactory>

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor the code that was provided to make it more accessible for those with disabilities. Using HTML semantics and CSS consolidation, I was able to achieve a higher accessibility by providing alt tags and minimizing code lines in CSS.

This problem solves the issue of accessibility for those who cannot see and use technology to read the information on their screens. I learned that creating a more logical, semantic HTML document makes it easier for those with disabilities to understand the flow of the webpage. Outside of HTML, I learned that CSS could be consolidated into fewer lines therefore making it more readable for other web developers and myself when making updates to the code.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

Please download all files related to this project. Once downloaded, open a code viewer or one of the files provided. Select index.html to see the frontend code (visualized webpage) or view the code in the backend through the Assets folder that leads to the CSS file. You can open this in your terminal, bash, or other text file application.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

I credit myself for refactoring this code down to a more accessible level. OSU Bootcamp provided the initial code for me to work on.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
